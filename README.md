Synchronized Reverse Scanning Collision Induced Dissociation in a Digital Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer for Improving the Fragment Ion Detection: Experiments and Simulations

This is an simulation file with SIMION, and the corrpesonding article would be published in the future.

1. Confirm you had installed the SIMION 8.1 or above;

2. First step, loaded the .iob file;

3. Refine

4. OK, just fly the ion, and the final result would be presented in the excel


Caution:  t-V  Square wave voltage loaded in the x and y directions with a fixed amplitude of 200 V0-p

               t-q  Mathieu q versus time for the excited ions

               3-cid-tf-397          The secular frequency change vs time for fragment ion with m/z=397 Th
               
               4-cid-tf-425          The secular frequency change vs time for fragment ion with m/z=425 Th

               5-cid-tf-556          The secular frequency change vs time for fragment ion with m/z=556 Th

               t-e       The ion kinetic change with time 

Thanks
